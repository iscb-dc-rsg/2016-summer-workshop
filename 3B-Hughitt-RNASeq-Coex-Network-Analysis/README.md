### Overview

In this presentation, I provide a simple overview of co-expression network
analysis, with an emphasis on the use of RNA-Seq data. A motivation for the use
of co-expression network analysis is provided and compared to other common
types of RNA-Seq analyses such as differential expression analysis and gene set
enrichment analysis. The use of adjacency matrices to represent networks is
explored for several different types of networks and a small synthetic dataset
is used to demonstrate each of the major steps in co-expression network
construction and module detection. The tutorial portion of the presentation
then applies some of these principles using a real dataset containing ~3000
genes, after filtering.
